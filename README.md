# Boltware

Why?
We want the world to know who we are.
We want the world to know we are available for hire
We want the world to know about our skills and experience

Who?
BoltWare offers a full package of coding services.  Its design and build was part of a collaborative Github project between Nicholas Peal, Marlen Awwad and Haitham Bweirat with the aim of furthering our .html and .css skills.

What?
An one page example website to show our design and build skills with .html and .css

How?
Weâ€™ve used Github to complete and manage our project, Atom for coding and Google Development tools to check accessibility and mobile responsiveness. Also a shout out to Neil for the load of his camera!
